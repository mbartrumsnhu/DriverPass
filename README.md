# DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a company that is trying to create a way for student drivers to set up appointments, study, and practice driving with a teacher. The goal for this project was to create a diagram and plan for the company to have to get this into a reality.
 
What did you do particularly well?
I did a great job coming up and developing diagrams for the project and even being able to describe what is happening to an audience. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would revise the section of the due dates. I think it would be nice to have something that would have teams and what they need to get done in a certain amount of time. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I just made sure this was the first thing I worked on. I wanted to make sure that it was what the customer wanted and once I got there I could get it to work for the bigger picture. It is important because the customer is important and sometimes we forget what they want and do what we want to do. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Making the diagram was my approach. Making it simple and clear. When I don’t have that we need to lay out all the details that the customer said and put that in certain areas and to see if that what is important.
